Hello,

1. Use ShoppingListEntry.of(int amount, Unit unit, String name, FoodType category) method to add entries to your shopping list.
- Unit is optional
- List will automatically be sorted by category, resembling a super market as good as possible

2. Replace the example list entries in Main with your list.
- leave the print block as is

3. List will be printed in a text file in ShoppingList folder.

4. The functionality to remove bought articles (optionally by unit) and update list will be added soon!
